                <p>I'm usually not a picky eater and will eat all sorts of food. But I prefer
                savory and spicy dishes compared to sweet. Part of it due to how I was raised, in 
                the Hmong culture, pepper and spicy sauces are common which is why my palette has
                become acustomed to it. Another reason why I prefer savory foods to sweet is 
                because theres more flavor.
